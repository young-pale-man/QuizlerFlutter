The Flutter application was written while studying how to work with Lists and Classes. 
Also getting started with the principles and basics of OOP.

## Interface💻

The application is a screen with questions and answer buttons. Also at the bottom there
is a row with images of icons whose meanings depend on the correctness of the user’s answers. 
After passing the test, a screen appears with the results and a restart button.

### Functionality🕹

The application contains a file with properties of the question class and its answer. A separate 
file contains a list of questions and possible answer options, the text of which can be replaced 
with another one to change the topics and contents of the test.

The application displays each of the test questions from a list with possible answer options.

If the answer is correct, a check mark icon is displayed in the line with answer icons. In case of 
an incorrect answer - an icon with a cross.

The results of correct answers are also recorded in a variable, the value of which is used by the final screen.

The final screen appears after completing all questions on the test and shows the number of correct 
answers relative to the total number of questions. It also contains a button that, when pressed, 
restarts the test.

As a result, we get an example of a testing application that can be modified and used to suit local needs✅❎
